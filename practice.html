            Electric and hybrid vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles 
            produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe emissions when operating in all-electric mode. HEV emissions benefits 
            vary by vehicle model and type of hybrid power system.
